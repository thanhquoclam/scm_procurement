Supply Chain Management Module Workflows
Overview
This document outlines the business processes and user workflows for an Odoo 17 module designed for Supply Chain Management. The module consolidates Purchase Requests (PRs), validates inventory levels, suggests Purchase Orders (POs) based on Purchase Agreements, and tracks PR fulfillment.

Description:
1.	Create Consolidation Session: The Supply Chain user initiates a new consolidation session from the dashboard.
2.	Select Date Range and Filters: User defines the time period for PR collection and optional filters (departments, categories).
3.	System Aggregates PRs: The system automatically collects all approved PRs and aggregates quantities by product.
4.	Review Consolidated Data: User reviews the consolidated information showing total demand per product.
5.	Adjustments: If necessary, the user can make manual adjustments to the consolidated data.
6.	Confirm Consolidation: User approves the consolidated view, making it ready for inventory validation.

    E --> F{Manual Overrides?}
    F -- Yes --> G[Adjust Purchasing Decisions]
    G --> E
    F -- No --> H[Confirm Purchase Needs]
    H --> I[End]
Description:
1.	Select Confirmed Consolidation: User selects a previously confirmed consolidation session.
2.	System Checks Inventory: The system automatically checks current stock levels for all products in the consolidation.
3.	Compare Demand vs. Available: The system identifies which products have sufficient stock and which need to be purchased.
4.	Review Shortages/Surpluses: User reviews the system's assessment of inventory status.
5.	Manual Overrides: User can override system decisions if needed (e.g., reserving stock for other purposes).
6.	Confirm Purchase Needs: User confirms the final list of products that need to be purchased.

**Implementation Status (April 2025):**
- The inventory validation process has been implemented with the `validate.inventory.wizard`.
- The wizard displays all consolidated lines with their current stock, required quantity, and available quantity.
- Users can filter to view only critical items (those with inventory status 'stockout' or 'insufficient').
- The system calculates the quantity to purchase based on the difference between required quantity and available quantity.
- After validation, users can proceed to PO creation.
- The consolidation session workflow has been updated to include the inventory validation state.
- Purchase orders created from the consolidation are linked to the session and visible in a dedicated tab.

Relationships with Existing Odoo Models
Integration with Purchase Request Module
The module extends the Purchase Request model from the OCA module:
class PurchaseRequest(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'purchase.request'
    
    consolidation_ids = fields.Many2many('scm.pr.consolidation.session', 
                                        string='Consolidation Sessions')
    fulfillment_plan_ids = fields.One2many('scm.pr.fulfillment.plan', 
                                           'purchase_request_id', 
                                           string='Fulfillment Plans')
    fulfillment_status = fields.Selection([
        ('not_included', 'Not Included'),
        ('pending', 'Pending'),
        ('in_progress', 'In Progress'),
        ('partially_fulfilled', 'Partially Fulfilled'),
        ('fulfilled', 'Fulfilled'),
        ('cancelled', 'Cancelled')
    ], string='Fulfillment Status', compute='_compute_fulfillment_status', store=True)
    expected_fulfillment_date = fields.Date(string='Expected Fulfillment Date', 
                                            compute='_compute_expected_fulfillment_date')
Similarly, the Purchase Request Line model is extended:
class PurchaseRequestLine(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'purchase.request.line'
    
    consolidated_line_ids = fields.Many2many('scm.consolidated.pr.line', 
                                            string='Consolidated Lines')
    fulfillment_plan_ids = fields.One2many('scm.pr.fulfillment.plan', 
                                           'purchase_request_line_id', 
                                           string='Fulfillment Plans')
    fulfillment_status = fields.Selection([
        ('not_included', 'Not Included'),
        ('pending', 'Pending'),
        ('in_progress', 'In Progress'),
        ('partially_fulfilled', 'Partially Fulfilled'),
        ('fulfilled', 'Fulfilled'),
        ('cancelled', 'Cancelled')
    ], string='Fulfillment Status', compute='_compute_fulfillment_status', store=True)
    expected_fulfillment_date = fields.Date(string='Expected Fulfillment Date', 
                                            compute='_compute_expected_fulfillment_date')
Integration with Purchase Order Model
class PurchaseOrder(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'purchase.order'
    
    purchase_suggestion_id = fields.Many2one('scm.purchase.suggestion', 
                                            string='Purchase Suggestion')
    consolidation_id = fields.Many2one('scm.pr.consolidation.session',
                                      string='PR Consolidation', 
                                      related='purchase_suggestion_id.consolidation_id',
                                      store=True)
    fulfillment_plan_ids = fields.One2many('scm.pr.fulfillment.plan', 
                                           'purchase_order_id', 
                                           string='PR Fulfillment Plans')
    affected_pr_count = fields.Integer(string='Affected PRs', 
                                      compute='_compute_affected_pr_count')
Similarly for Purchase Order Line:
class PurchaseOrderLine(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'purchase.order.line'
    
    suggestion_line_id = fields.Many2one('scm.purchase.suggestion.line', 
                                        string='Suggestion Line')
    fulfillment_plan_ids = fields.One2many('scm.pr.fulfillment.plan', 
                                           'purchase_order_line_id', 
                                           string='PR Fulfillment Plans')
    pr_line_count = fields.Integer(string='PR Lines', 
                                  compute='_compute_pr_line_count')
Integration with Stock Module
For tracking internal transfers:
class StockPicking(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'stock.picking'
    
    fulfillment_plan_ids = fields.Many2many('scm.pr.fulfillment.plan', 
                                           string='PR Fulfillment Plans')
    is_pr_fulfillment = fields.Boolean(string='Is PR Fulfillment', 
                                      compute='_compute_is_pr_fulfillment', store=True)
Indexes and Database Optimization
For performance reasons, the following indexes should be created:
# In scm.consolidated.pr.line model
_sql_constraints = [
    ('consolidation_product_uniq', 
     'unique(consolidation_id, product_id)', 
     'A product can only appear once in a consolidation session!')
]

# In scm.purchase.suggestion.line model
_sql_constraints = [
    ('suggestion_product_uniq', 
     'unique(suggestion_id, product_id)', 
     'A product can only appear once in a purchase suggestion!')
]

# Other indexes
_indexes = [
    ('consolidation_id', 'state'),  # For scm.consolidated.pr.line
    ('consolidation_id', 'vendor_id', 'state'),  # For scm.purchase.suggestion
    ('purchase_request_id', 'state'),  # For scm.pr.fulfillment.plan
    ('product_id', 'consolidation_id')  # For scm.consolidated.pr.line
]

Development Approach
I recommend implementing this module in phases:
Phase 1: Core Consolidation
â€¢	PR Consolidation Session model and views
â€¢	Consolidated PR Line model and views
â€¢	Basic workflow for creating and reviewing consolidations
â€¢	Minimal reporting
Phase 2: Inventory Validation
â€¢	Integration with stock module
â€¢	Inventory validation workflow
â€¢	Stock shortage/surplus reporting
â€¢	Change detection for inventory levels
Phase 3: Purchase Suggestions
â€¢	Purchase Suggestion models
â€¢	Integration with purchase agreements
â€¢	PO creation workflow
â€¢	Vendor selection logic
Phase 4: Fulfillment Tracking
â€¢	PR Fulfillment Plan model
â€¢	Integration with PO receipts
â€¢	Internal transfer suggestions
â€¢	PR status updates
Phase 5: Change Management & Optimization
â€¢	Change log implementation
â€¢	Notification system
â€¢	Performance optimizations
â€¢	Advanced reporting
Technical Considerations
1.	Performance: Consider database indexing and query optimization for larger datasets.
2.	Scalability: Design the module to handle large numbers of PRs and products.
3.	Concurrency: Implement proper locking mechanisms for concurrent sessions.
4.	User Experience: Make the interface intuitive with proper visual cues and guidance.
5.	Extensibility: Design with future enhancements in mind, using proper inheritance patterns.
6.	Upgradability: Follow Odoo's best practices to ensure smooth upgrades.
Would you like to focus on any specific aspect of the implementation to discuss in more detail?
