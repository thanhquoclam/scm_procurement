# SCM Procurement Module - Phase 2 Implementation Status

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-04-10

## 1. Overview

This document provides a status update on the implementation of Phase 2 (Inventory Validation) of the SCM Procurement Module. It details what has been implemented, what is currently in progress, and what remains to be done.

## 2. Completed Features

### 2.1. Inventory Validation Wizard

The `validate.inventory.wizard` has been implemented with the following features:

- **Wizard Structure**: The wizard displays consolidated lines from the consolidation session, showing current stock, required quantity, and available quantity.
- **Inventory Status Calculation**: The wizard calculates inventory status (sufficient, partial, insufficient, stockout) based on current stock and required quantity.
- **Quantity to Purchase Calculation**: The wizard computes the quantity to purchase based on the difference between required quantity and available quantity.
- **Critical Issues Filtering**: Users can toggle between viewing all items or only critical items (those with inventory status 'stockout' or 'insufficient').
- **Validation Process**: The wizard allows users to validate inventory and proceed to PO creation.

### 2.2. Purchase Order Creation

The `create.po.wizard` has been implemented with the following features:

- **Wizard Structure**: The wizard displays lines that need to be purchased, showing product, quantity, and price information.
- **Vendor Selection**: Users can select a vendor for the purchase order.
- **PO Creation**: The wizard creates a purchase order with the selected lines and vendor.
- **Consolidation Link**: The created purchase order is linked to the consolidation session.

### 2.3. Consolidation Session Workflow

The consolidation session workflow has been updated to include:

- **State Management**: The session now transitions through states: draft → selecting_lines → in_progress → validated → inventory_validation → po_creation → po_created → done.
- **Inventory Validation Button**: A button to initiate inventory validation has been added to the form view.
- **Purchase Order Tab**: A tab to view purchase orders linked to the session has been added to the form view.

## 3. In Progress Features

### 3.1. Inventory Exception Handling

- **Exception Approval**: The system is set up to handle inventory exceptions, but the approval workflow is still being refined.
- **Manager Approval**: The system can request manager approval for critical inventory issues, but the notification system is still being tested.

### 3.2. Safety Stock Updates

- **Safety Stock Calculation**: The system can update safety stock levels based on validation, but the calculation logic is still being refined.

## 4. Remaining Work

### 4.1. Testing and Refinement

- **User Testing**: Comprehensive testing with actual users is needed to identify any usability issues.
- **Performance Optimization**: Some queries may need optimization for large datasets.

### 4.2. Documentation

- **User Guide**: A comprehensive user guide for the inventory validation process is needed.
- **Technical Documentation**: Additional technical documentation for developers may be needed.

## 5. Known Issues

1. **Inventory Status Mismatch**: There was an issue with inventory status values not matching between the consolidated lines and the validation wizard. This has been fixed by updating the `default_get` method in the `ValidateInventoryWizard`.

2. **Purchase Order Tab Visibility**: The purchase order tab was not visible in the consolidation session form view. This has been fixed by adding the `purchase_order_ids` field to the `scm.pr.consolidation.session` model.

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Complete Exception Handling**: Finalize the inventory exception handling workflow.
2. **Refine Safety Stock Updates**: Complete the safety stock update functionality.
3. **User Testing**: Conduct comprehensive testing with actual users.
4. **Documentation**: Create user guides and technical documentation.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize queries for large datasets.

## 7. Conclusion

The Phase 2 implementation of the SCM Procurement Module is progressing well. The core functionality for inventory validation and purchase order creation is in place, and the workflow for consolidation sessions has been updated to include these new features. The remaining work focuses on refining the exception handling, completing the safety stock updates, and conducting comprehensive testing.
